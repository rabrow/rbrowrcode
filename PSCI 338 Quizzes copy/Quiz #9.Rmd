```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '~/Dropbox/PSCI338')
```

```{r}
library(lmtest)
library(sandwich)
library(gmodels)
library(biostat3)
library(car)
load("RawData/ETOV2006.rdata")
```

#### #1
```{r}
linMod <- lm(g2006~treatment_chk2,data=ETOV2006)
coeftest(linMod, vcov = vcovHC(linMod, type="HC1"))
#90% Confidence Interval
lincom(linMod, c("(Intercept)","treatment_chk2 Self"),
       vcov = vcovHC(linMod, type="HC1"),level = 0.90)
```

#### #2

The probability of committing Type 1 error if rejecting the null hypothesis that someone who receives the "self mailing" is just as likely to vote as someone in the Control is 31.20%. Therefore, the estimate is not significant.

#### #3

Reporting this p-value does not take into account the fact that multiple comparisons will increase the probability of making a Type 1 error; to correct for this, you need to lower the alpha.
